# ArduinoRoboCar
A robotic car created to annoy my poor dog, Mr. Crunchy, a black and white pomeranian. 

Parts:
Roboduino Smart Robot Car from Yahboom (a wifi camera to phone, remote, rgb lights, buzzer, ultrasonic sensor, servos, TT motors and  wheels, tracking module, etc (Comes with a great AR explansion board - lots of avaliable pins)
)


Additional parts I have added: 
a canakit 5V fan to keep core cooler
A 4 pin LCD screen addition - Hilego
A gesture sensor
Other sensors if camera fails as a detecting device- may attach an infared sensor. 


Goals :
After messing around with uploading some music to its buzzer and playing with its needless amount of rgb lights to give it that just-right menacing look, I would like to program it to chase my dog using the smart wifi camera to target the color black (which my dog is) and
to go in the direction of the color. Obviously any black objects will confuse it. It should easily be able to spot him given a gesture sensor, infared, and the ultrasonic
sensor to help the camera input differentiate him (warm, moving , and black) from the non living black objects in the home (the vaccum cleaner, trash can, etc), then the machine should drive in that direction until it no longer senses infared and the color black.
